My name is Drew Owen. I am a data scientist living in Atlanta, GA, USA.

## Short Bio
My father was in the military so by the time I was 10 I had lived on three continents. I came to Georgia Tech for undergraduate and received a BS in Mechanical Engineering. For somewhat of a change of pace for me, I stayed in one place and continued on at GT for graduate school and completed a PhD from the Bioengineering program, focusing on MEMS and Microfluidics ([publications to be added](./publications.html)).


## Other Interests

### Maker projects

Based on my previous engineering education, I still dabble in projects in the world of atoms via machining and 3D printing:
* [FSU Chief Osceola Logo](https://a360.co/3Q0gRDh) for my brother-in-law. It was part of sibling Secret Santa exchange where the emphasis was on hand-made (or in my case hand-drawn and then machine printed)
* [Small gap-filler](https://a360.co/3SqW0bM) for a toy car track in our local park. My son loves playing on this track and there was a samll gap in it. I saw a problem and wanted to fix it for all the neighbor kids that bring their cars to the park (and there are many of them). 
* [Wing](https://a360.co/3Q0gRDh) for a [Jay Garrick Flash](https://hyperborea.org/flash/jay.html) helmet. I originally used this design for a full-size helmet that I would wear to DragonCon but this file is a shrunk down version that I used to fix a small Jay Garrick statue I owned who's wings had broken off.

### Roleplaying Games

I have been an avid tabletop roleplayer for more than 20 years. I have collected here some thoughts and projects related to the hobby.
* [Roleplaying Game Dice](https://github.com/owendl/rpg_dice) I put together a short article considering the statistics of dice mechanics and player experience. I continue to add to it as I experience more games and systems (you could almost think of it as a living blog post).
* [RPG a Day 2020]()
