My name is Drew Owen. I am a data scientist living in Atlanta, GA, USA.

## Short Bio
My father was in the military so by the time I was 10 I had lived on three continents. I came to Georgia Tech for undergraduate and received a BS in Mechanical Engineering. For somewhat of a change of pace for me, I stayed in one place and continued on at GT for graduate school and completed a PhD from the Bioengineering program, focusing on MEMS and Microfluidics ([publications to be added](./publications.html)).

While in graduate school I met the woman that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with and she wanted to spend the rest of her life in Atlanta. As a consequence, I began to apply my scientific and engineering problem-solving mindset to data science challenges. I have now been [working](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drew-owen-phd/) in the field since 2016.

### Data Science in the real world

Besides working as a data scientist in my professional life, I also work on various side projects that allow me to use my data science skills to make something in the real world.

* [Porches & Pies Pie Box Optimization](https://github.com/owendl/pnp_boxes_2020) In 2020, we pivoted our neighborhood festival from a pie bake-off to direct sales of mini-pies from local bakers starting up their businesses. We wanted to find the cheapest possible combination of pies we could sell that also met minimum requirements of types of pies, pies purchased from bakers and a few other constraints. After an initial attempt at doing this by hand, I realized it fit in naturally as an optimization problem and took the opportunity to teach myself pyomo. We used this model to guide our purchasing decisions and had our most profitable festval ever.
* [Roleplaying Game Dice](https://github.com/owendl/rpg_dice) I put together a short article considering the statistics of dice mechanics and how that might inform a player's experience. I continue to add to it as I experience more games and systems (you could almost think of it as a living blog post).
* [Discord Card RPG Bot](https://github.com/owendl/cardrpgdiscord) I used the Discord Python SDK to create a Discord bot that would allow a group of people to play deck-based RPGs. Currently, only Juggernaut has been implemented (but that game is so good do you really need another). Users have to supply their own decks to avoid copyright infringement.
* [Warhorn Lambda Game Submission](https://github.com/owendl/warhorn_lambda) [Warhorn](https://warhorn.net) is a platform for convention organizers to schedule and run RPG events with game sessions and player sign-ups. I created an AWS Lambda function (triggered via a CloudWatch timed event) to read from a public Google Sheet and then programmatically create and publish sessions to a Warhorn event. The games are submitted by submission to Warhorn's GraphQL API.


### Maker projects

Based on my previous engineering education, I still dabble in projects in the world of atoms via machining and 3D printing:
* [FSU Chief Osceola Logo](https://a360.co/3Q0gRDh) for my brother-in-law. It was part of sibling Secret Santa exchange where the emphasis was on hand-made (or in my case hand-drawn and then machine printed)
* [Small gap-filler](https://a360.co/3SqW0bM) for a toy car track in our local park. My son loves playing on this track and there was a samll gap in it. I saw a problem and wanted to fix it for all the neighbor kids that bring their cars to the park (and there are many of them). 
* [Wing](https://a360.co/3Q0gRDh) for a [Jay Garrick Flash](https://hyperborea.org/flash/jay.html) helmet. I originally used this design for a full-size helmet that I would wear to DragonCon but this file is a shrunk down version that I used to fix a small Jay Garrick statue I owned who's wings had broken off.

### Additional writing
* [RPG a Day 2020](https://github.com/owendl/rpgaday2020/tree/master) A series of essays I did as part of the RPG a Day 2020 initiative, speaking to various aspects of roleplaying games and my history with them (probably the least technical project but some fun reads)
