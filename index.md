My name is Drew Owen. I am a data scientist living in Atlanta, GA, USA.

## Short Bio
My father was in the military so by the time I was 10 I had lived on three continents. I came to Georgia Tech for undergraduate and received a BS in Mechanical Engineering. For somewhat of a change of pace for me, I stayed and GT for graduate school and completed a PhD from the Bioengineering program, focusing on MEMS and Microfluidics (![publications to be added]()).



## Other Interests

### Maker projects

Based on my previous engineering education, I still dabble in projects in the world of atoms via machining and 3D printing:
* ![FSU Chief Osceola Logo](https://a360.co/3Q0gRDh) for my brother-in-law. It was part of sibling Secret Santa exchange where the emphasis was on hand-made (or in my case hand-drawn and then machine printed)
* ![Small gap-filler](https://a360.co/3SqW0bM) for a toy car track in our local park. My son loves playing on this track and there was a samll gap in it. I saw a problem and wanted to fix it for all the neighbor kids that bring their cars to the park (and there are many of them). 
* ![Wing](https://a360.co/3Q0gRDh) for a ![Jay Garrick Flash](https://hyperborea.org/flash/jay.html) helmet. I originally used this design for a full-size helmet that I would wear to DragonCon but this file is a shrunk down version that I used to fix a small Jay Garrick statue I owned who's wings had broken off.
